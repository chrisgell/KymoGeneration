Generate kymographs for diffusion (or otherwise).

(C) Chris Gell 2017

1. Load a microtubule and stream. Check to see if you liek the look of it then proceed....
2. On the MT image draw line ROIs over each tube, add these to the ROI manager each time (press T) - ensure that the ROIs extend at least 10 pixels off the ends of the MT.
3. Load KymosFromSnapsAndStreamsCGv1.ijm and Run it
4. Enter whne promted a short identifier - generall date, protein, conc.
5. When promted identify the MT image, then the stream image.
6. Choose a directory for the results to be saved.
7. Choose wether to save PNGs of all images - generally not necessary, useful if you want to print out examples for a lab book though


In the directory you chose you iwll fing a zip file with the ROIs of the microtubules analysed, the kymographs and a microtubule 'map' of the whole FOV.

The kymogrpahs show which images they came from in the file names so everything should be traceable. I suggest analysis all similar experiments (conc, protein) placing all the data in a single folder. 

When complete proceed to the AutoKymoAnalysis.ijm macro.




Analyse kymographs for binding events (number and time).

(C) Chris Gell 2017


1. Load a kymograph, open the ROI mamanger and go to More>>Options and tick, 'Use ROI names as labels'.
2. Load and run AutoKymoAnalysis.ijm
3. Choose the kymo
4. When promted modify the ROI to include only background. CLick OK
5. Drag over the next ROI and put it on the left end (with the rectangle ROI tool, click-drag the number) click ok.
6. Repeat for the other end and the lattice when promted.
7. When promted choose a directory to save the results in.
8. I suggest chreating a folder called kymo analysis inside the folder containing the kymos.
9. RUn through the analysis and delete the ROIs that are not correct.Add in any new ones you wish. These must be added as rectanguler ROIS. Only the height is important.
10.The analsysi generates 4 text files. One each with the binding times for the events on the lattice and either end, and one with a summary info, such as the total number of end and lattice events and microtubule length.
11. After you have analysed all the kymographs group all of the results across the kymos into 3 folders (one each for ends, lattice and summary info).
12. CLose all open windows.




Igor Pro 

1. Open an experiment and load the ParsingSMKymoData.ipf
2. From the 'LoadKymoAnalysisResults' menu run the required analysis, each time selecting the relevant folders created in step 11 above.
3. This will create a number of data waves (most usefull are EndBindTime, LatBindTime, SummaryEndEvents, SummaryLatEvents and SummaryLength).
